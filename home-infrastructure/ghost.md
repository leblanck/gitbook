# Ghost

## Intro

This documentation is for our blog: [The Workbench (blog.leblanc.sh)](https://blog.leblanc.sh). Our Ghost instance is self-hosted in Digital Ocean.

Credentials for Digital Ocean are provided in 1Password.&#x20;

Please see [infrastructure-configuration.md](infrastructure-configuration.md "mention") for a diagram of how Digital Ocean fits into our enrivonment.&#x20;

## Managing The ghost-prod Droplet

Most management things can be done via the Digital Ocean console (upgrade instance size, restarting, etc)

If you need to manage either the Ghost install itself, Ubuntu, or any other isntalled service on this droplet you will need to SSH into ghost-prod. Please use the public IP for this instance. The root password for the instance is found in 1Password.&#x20;

The DNS A-Record for blog.leblanc.sh is managed in Netlify.&#x20;
